[Usefulaaltomap](http://usefulaaltomap.fi) is a map of Aalto that
actually helps people find what the need, unlike the existing
campus maps.  We aim to bring all the practical information about
the campus to to one place.  This is an open-source project, and
our raw information comes from OpenStreet map, with a nice
interface and local Aalto information on top.

This is a collaborative, open-source project: please contribute
data, and if you want, code or design!
